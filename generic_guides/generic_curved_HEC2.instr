* PIK reactor beamtube H3 facing cold neutron source. Handles additionaly the thermal regime of CNS and no CNS at all situation.
*
* %Parameters
* guide_start_width: [m] Initial width of guide (where to focus neutrons from source)
* guide_start_height: [m]  Initial height of guide (where to focus neutrons from source)
* source_lambda_min: [AA] Minimal wavelength to create
* source_lambda_max: [AA] Maximal wavelength to create
* cold_regime: [num] 1 corresponds to normal operation, 0 corresponds to thermal regime, -1 corresponds to no container situation
